## 🎯 Mission

We conduct **toxicogenomic research** to understand how chemical contaminants impact human health, wildlife, and ecosystems.  
Our goal is to develop *mechanistic, multidisciplinary, and translational* toxicology — a **“toxicology for life”** approach.

## 🔬 Research Vision & Approach

The Karlsson Lab works at the intersection of **experimental toxicology**, **computational modelling**, and **multi-omics**.  
We integrate *human, wildlife, and model systems* to uncover how environmental chemicals affect biological function.

### Core Research Themes
- Mechanisms of action of environmental contaminants (pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, pesticides, metals, air pollution)  
- Mechanism-driven and systems toxicology approaches across molecular, in vitro, in vivo, and human studies  
- Development of **New Approach Methodologies (NAMs)** for chemical and pharmaceutical risk assessment  
- Exploring the **human health–environmental health nexus**, recognising that ecosystem impacts ultimately affect people  
- Advancing **data-driven toxicology** through bioinformatics and high-performance computing (HPC) workflows  

We believe that **multidisciplinary and quantitative toxicology** is key for innovation in risk assessment and environmental protection.

## 🧪 Where We Work

Our laboratory is located at **SciLifeLab**, a national infrastructure for high-throughput molecular technologies.  
We collaborate closely with **Stockholm University**, **Karolinska Institute**, **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**, and **Uppsala University**.  

We are part of the **Department of Environmental Science (ACES)** at Stockholm University —  
ranked among the world’s top institutions in environmental science.
